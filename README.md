To write the program I used copilot quite a bit to first of all generate some rooms for the maze as well as I generated the constructors for each room and used override methods to print out descriptions for each room. I used copilot to generate the descriptions and memos that prompt the user for inputs. After the base requirements were met I created some more rooms that I though would be in a maze and each room having something different in it. I added plenty of extra items for the user to pick up and increase their score. There are plenty of other cool things that I would like to add as I learn more about java.
